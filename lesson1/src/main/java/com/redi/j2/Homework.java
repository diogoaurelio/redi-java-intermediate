 * Write a program that for given value of variable ‘height’ will print out the right-half

 * The tree starts with “I” on the top and ends with “M” on the bottom.
 * The tree is built from “X” and “Y” characters one after another
 * For example, for an height of 6 it will print:
 I
 XY
 XYX
 XYXY
 XYXYX
 M
